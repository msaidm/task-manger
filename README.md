[Task Manager App](https://task-manger-t1fs-b2m35abwf-msaidms-projects.vercel.app/)

## Task Manger App:

I used Next.js and Firebase to develop a proficient task management tool. Users have the capability to register accounts, log in, create tasks, edit existing tasks, and delete tasks seamlessly. Each task is equipped with a title, due date, completion status, and description, which can be manipulated using a rich text editor for enhanced functionality and user experience.

## System Requirements:

Node.js 18.17 or later.
macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

## Getting Started
To start developing with Next.js, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project folder.
Install dependencies by running the following command in your terminal.

```bash
npm install
npm next dev
```
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to see the result.
