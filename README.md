Here's a brief explanation of each directory and file:

pages/: This directory contains all of your application's pages. Each file in this directory corresponds to a route in your application.

api/: This directory is used for creating API routes.
_app.js: This file is used to initialize pages. You can override the default App component here.
_document.js: This file is used to customize the HTML document that Next.js renders. You can use it to add custom scripts or styles.
public/: This directory contains static assets such as images, fonts, etc. These assets are served at the root of your application.

components/: This directory contains reusable React components that can be used across multiple pages in your application.

styles/: This directory contains global stylesheets for your application.

package.json: This file contains metadata about the project as well as a list of dependencies.

README.md: The README file provides information about the project, its structure, and how to get started.

Feel free to explore and customize the project structure according to your requirements.
